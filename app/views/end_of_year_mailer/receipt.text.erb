Thank you for your generous gift to support the Techlahoma Foundation. In 2018, your gift helped support 39 user groups, 2 national conferences, and provide over 500 hours of free STEM education in Oklahoma. And since Techlahoma is all volunteer run, 100% of your money went directly towards supporting and growing the local tech community. We have had a great year, and we hope for your continued support in 2019 and beyond.
