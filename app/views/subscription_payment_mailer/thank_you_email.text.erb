Gift Delivery:

We are currently planning to throw celebration parties simultaneously in OKC and in Tulsa sometime in early summer. You can pick up your gift there if you can attend.

If you cannot attend either party, your gift will be mailed after the party to:

  <%= @donation.name %>
  <%= @donation.address1 %>
  <% if @donation.address2.present? %>
  <%= @donation.address2 %>
  <% end %>
  <%= @donation.city %> <%= @donation.state %>, <%= @donation.zipcode %>
<% end %>


If you have any questions or concerns, you can respond to this email and let us know.

Thanks,
